# LogFlow

LogFlow is a distributed, fault-tolerant log ingestion and search system designed to handle high-throughput logs from microservices in a scalable and reliable way.

## Motivation
Modern distributed systems generate massive volumes of logs across services, machines, and regions. LogFlow explores how production-grade logging pipelines ingest, buffer, process, and search logs while remaining resilient to traffic spikes and component failures.

## High-Level Architecture
Log producers send structured logs to a stateless ingestion service. Logs are buffered through a message queue, processed asynchronously by background workers, and indexed into a search-optimized storage layer. A query API enables fast filtering and time-based searches.

## Core Components
- **Ingest API** – Accepts logs over HTTP and appends them to the queue
- **Message Queue** – Buffers logs and decouples ingestion from processing
- **Indexer Workers** – Normalize and batch logs for efficient indexing
- **Search Storage** – Stores indexed logs optimized for query performance
- **Query API** – Exposes search and filtering capabilities

## Design Goals
- Horizontal scalability
- At-least-once log delivery
- Backpressure handling
- High write throughput
- Sub-second search latency
- Failure resilience

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Language: Python 
- Queue: Redis Streams potentially Kafka
- Storage: OpenSearch / Elasticsearch
- Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose

## Status
🚧 In active development. Initial ingestion service and local infrastructure setup in progress.

## Learning Objectives
This project focuses on building intuition around:
- Distributed systems design
- Queue-based architectures
- Asynchronous processing
- Indexing and search tradeoffs
- Reliability and failure handling
